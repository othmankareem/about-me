<h3 align="left">My journey in progamming</h3>

<p>
I started my journey in coding when i got a book form my father he said study this and i said okay
(what did you think i was gonna say something dramatic) <br>
I started coding, i thought it was okay until i saw a chapter in my book named "how to make a game"
and i was like so cool i can make games(i was so stupid).<br>
well that did not turn out well, i still did not know that game engines existed and i was not going
in the gaming industry anyway(my father told me not to).<br>
by now you might have noticed that all these lines have brackets at the end, im not gonna put one here
hahahaha(actually i did hahahahaha).<br>
<br>
Oh did i mention i am the youngest and i am still so productive, thats why it makes me good comparison
for my cousins, im asian by the way.<br>
